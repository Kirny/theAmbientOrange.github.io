Hello! I am currently a rising fourth-year studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science</a>. I plan on graduating a semester early in December 2017. My experience lies primarily in web and mobile application development. I will be an Associate Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/">Capital One</a> for the summer of 2017, and I am also the lead Android developer for the non-profit organization <a href="http://miraclemessages.org/">Miracle Messages</a>. 
<br>
<br>
I also enjoy helping my fellow classmates learn! I am currently a teaching assistant for CS 2110: Software Development Methods, taught by the wonderful <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/people/faculty/basit.html">Professor Nada Basit</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/people/faculty/edwards.html">Professor David Edwards</a>. This course introduces students to Java and object-oriented programming, as well as unit testing, basic data structures and algorithms, and best code practices.
<br>
<br>
I will also be a teaching assistant for CS 4970/4971: Service Learning Practicum the upcoming Fall semester, taught by the fantastic <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/">Professor Aaron Bloomfield</a>. This is a year-long course where teams of students help build systems for local non-profit organizations that will help with an initiative and improve the community. This course fulfills the technical capstone project requirement, and I will help students by developing course scripts/tools and redesigning the course management site in Django.
<br>
<br>
In my free time, I love working on random coding projects, going on runs (3.23 miles every day!), playing video games, browsing memes, participating in hackathons (goodbye sleep), watching movies, playing with my cat Mochi, and spending time with family and friends!
